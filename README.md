# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Running the Project

1. Fork, clone, or download a .ZIP copy of the file structure [here](https://github.com/paulakedouk/Feed-reader-testing-project.git)
2. Navigate to index.html on your local machine and open it in a web browser
3. Head to the end of the page to see the results of running the Jasmine tests
4. Navigate to jasmine/spec/feedreader.js to see the test suites I've written
